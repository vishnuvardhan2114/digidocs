- [ ] Cloudflare API token created
- [ ] Secrets added to GitHub repository
- [ ] Test automated deployment
- [ ] Preview deployments work for PRs

### 17. Database Backups
- [ ] Neon automatic backups enabled
- [ ] Backup schedule configured
- [ ] Test restore process (in development)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails
- **Issue**: "pnpm: command not found"
  - **Fix**: Ensure NODE_VERSION is set to 18 or higher
  
- **Issue**: "DATABASE_URL is not defined"
  - **Fix**: Check environment variables in Cloudflare dashboard
  
- **Issue**: Turbo cache errors
  - **Fix**: Add `--force` to build command temporarily

### Runtime Errors
- **Issue**: "Module not found"
  - **Fix**: Verify `transpilePackages` in `next.config.mjs`
  
- **Issue**: OAuth not working
  - **Fix**: Double-check redirect URLs in Google Console
  
- **Issue**: Database connection errors
  - **Fix**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow page loads
  - **Fix**: Check Cloudflare Analytics for bottlenecks
  - **Fix**: Optimize images and reduce bundle size
